## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow (I think?)

### What I learned

I learned some more about changing the layout based on the screensize and how to use flexbox to achieve this. I am honestly not completely happy with this solution and during the process I got the feeling that using grid instead/additionally could have been better here buit the challenge was still fun.


### Continued development

I still need to learn more about layout with flexbox and grid since I still make some dumb mistakes from time to time and dont use it optimally. Gonna use it on more projects and start reading more solutions of other people to get better at it. :)

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This site always helps when trying to learn more about cool stuff you can do with CSS. Their guides to flexbox and grid are very helpfull aswell.
